## Purpose
This repository serves as a living document for ideating, designing, and documenting the development of **The Chair**. Here, we explore concepts, calculations, algorithms, and code related to various aspects of the project. The document is intended to evolve alongside the project—from early ideation through prototyping to the final product.

---

## Definition and Design Intent

The [Chair](defs/chair.md) is envisioned to embody the following qualities:
- **[Comfortable](features/comfort)**
- **[Ergonomic](features/ergonomy)**
- **[Repairable](features/repair)**
- **[Open](features/openness)**
- **[Sustainable](features/sustainability)**
- **[Accessible](features/access)**
- **[Upcycled](features/lifeCycle)**
- **[Beautiful](features/aesthetics)**

**Wishes**  
This is our initial wish list and may evolve as we refine our semantic and technical definitions. 

- For example, I wish we consider a **tensegrity structure** for its organic feel, and also to potentially integrating a pulley-based mechanism that allows the chair's structure to **embed** calculations.

## Literature Review

### Chairs We Admire

Below is a comparison of chairs that inspire our design based on our desired features:

| Chair                                                 | Comfort | Ergonomic | Repairable | Sustainable | Accessible | Upcycled | Beautiful | Open |
| :---------------------------------------------------- | :-----: | :-------: | :--------: | :---------: | :--------: | :------: | :-------: | :--: |

## Conceptual Models

### Concept Chairs
This section will collect models, abstractions, and conceptual sketches for various chair designs. Future iterations will include more detailed ideas and diagrams.

### Comfortable Chairs
- **Alleged Comfort:**  
  - Example: [Wassily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wassily_Chair)
- **Verified Comfort:**  
  - (Details on testing methodologies and evaluations will be added as prototypes are developed.)

## Inspirations

Below are the technical concepts and structural inspirations influencing our design:
- [Compliant Mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliant_mechanism)
- [Artificial Muscles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_muscle)
- [Pulley Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulley)
- [Tensegrity Structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensegrity)
- [Joinery Techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joinery)

*Note:* Each linked concept will be explored further in dedicated documents to clarify its relevance and potential integration.

---

## Additional Taxonomies

We plan to integrate various taxonomies to systematically evaluate and connect aspects of our design. Future categories may include:
- Material Properties
- Ergonomics & User Profiles
- Environmental Impact
- Manufacturing Techniques
